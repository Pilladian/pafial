Features:
  - creating environments with start and destination
  - multiple implementations of path finding algorithms

Functionality:
  - Creating new environment: 
    - b -> Begin (red) 
    - e -> End (blue)
    - d -> default (black)
    - space -> saving image
  - Finding Path: 
    - java -jar pafial.jar /path/to/env.png <Algorithm to use>
